## We'll install our dependencies first.

In your terminal, add this line

```
npm i
```

To demonstrate we'll need to open three terminal windows.

Next we need to run the server, run this in one of the terminals

```
npm run start server
```

Then we can start two clients to see websockets usage in action.
In two other terminal windows add this code

```
npm run start client
```

Now Have two of the client windows open side by side, and type anything in it and watch it appear on the other client window. Pretty Neat HUH?!
